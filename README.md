# Hockey Quiz Game
This is a simple quiz game related to hockey and NHL knowledge to refine basic Python skills during my programming learning process.

## About This Project
This customizable quiz game runs in the terminal and tests the user's hockey knowledge by asking 5 multiple-choice questions. Users select an answer by typing the corresponding option (A, B, C, D, or E). Once all questions are answered, the program evaluates the responses and displays:
- The correct and incorrect answers
- The user's final score as a percentage
  
## Why I Created This Project
